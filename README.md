## Introduction
The Solidity Smart-Contract Advisor is a cutting-edge tool designed to extend the capabilities of traditional language models in understanding and advising on Solidity smart contracts. At its core, the project integrates OpenAI's language models with a vast repository of verified smart contracts and comprehensive Solidity documentation, creating a specialized, context-aware system capable of delivering expert insights in the realm of smart contract development.

This project represents a significant stride in bridging the gap between general-purpose language models and the nuanced, specialized requirements of blockchain development. By training on over 5,000 verified smart contracts and extensive Solidity documentation, the advisor provides not just theoretical answers, but practical, real-world advice grounded in verified code and documentation.

Success was measured by the system's ability to accurately parse, understand, and provide context-relevant advice on complex Solidity queries. This was achieved through a sophisticated blend of technologies, each playing a crucial role in enhancing the system's effectiveness.

## Core Components
### Smart Contract Retrieval
Using etherscan.py, downloaded 5,000 known and verified smart contracts from Etherscan API. This forms the backbone of our analysis, providing real-world smart contract code for embedding and analysis.

### Documentation Processing
Alongside smart contracts, extracted documentation as HTML files from the Solidity documentation website, ensuring a comprehensive base for the language model.

### LangChain and Embedding Tokenizer
Custom-built LangChain RetrievalQA model processes the above data. I've created embedding chunks of size 1000 with an overlap of 1000, resulting in around 200,000 chunks for detailed analysis.

### Parsing and Embedding
For smart contracts, a Solidity-specific parser breaks down the contracts into manageable chunks. 
For the HTML content (the official documentation of the solidity), I employ a standard text splitter. These parsed chunks are then embedded for further processing.

### Weaviate Vector Database
In this project, the Weaviate Vector Database, equipped with the text2vec-contextionary module, plays a pivotal role in managing and querying vectorized data derived from Solidity smart contracts and documentation. Vector databases like Weaviate are designed to handle vectorized data â€“ essentially, data points represented in multi-dimensional space. This is particularly useful in the realm of machine learning and natural language processing, where complex data can be vectorized for efficient and meaningful analysis.

Weaviate utilizes machine learning models to convert text data into these vectors, allowing for high-speed and semantically relevant searches. In the context of the Solidity Smart-Contract Advisor, Weaviate stores and manages the embeddings (vector representations) of Solidity contracts and documentation. These embeddings capture the nuanced meanings and contexts of the text, enabling the system to provide accurate, context-aware responses to user queries.

The text2vec-contextionary module specifically is critical for understanding the textual context. It allows the system to interpret the meaning behind words and phrases in the context of Solidity, enhancing the relevance and accuracy of search results and responses.

The role of Weaviate in this project is multifaceted:
1. **Efficient Data Retrieval**: By converting text into vectors, Weaviate enables fast and efficient retrieval of relevant information.
2. **Semantic Search**: It goes beyond keyword matching, allowing for semantic search capabilities. This means the system can understand and respond to queries not just based on keywords but also the underlying concepts and contexts.
3. **Scalability**: Weaviate is designed for scalability, handling the large volume of data generated from the 5,000 smart contracts and extensive documentation.
4. **Integration with AI Models**: Its compatibility with AI models like OpenAI's embeddings makes it an ideal choice for projects that merge traditional data storage with advanced AI capabilities.
5. **Overcoming Tokenization Limits**: One of the challenges with traditional Language Model (LM) tokenization is the limit on the number of tokens that can be processed in a single request. By creating and managing embeddings, Weaviate provides a workaround to these limitations. It allows for the handling and analysis of large and complex texts (like entire smart contracts) beyond the token limit imposed by LLMs. This feature is crucial in maintaining the integrity and context of longer documents or codes, enabling more thorough and accurate analysis in the Solidity Smart-Contract Advisor.

For more information on Weaviate and its capabilities, you can visit their official website and documentation:
- [Weaviate Official Website](https://www.semi.technology/developers/weaviate/)
- [Weaviate Documentation](https://www.semi.technology/developers/weaviate/current/)

The use of Weaviate in this project ensures that the Solidity Smart-Contract Advisor is not only powerful in its analytical capabilities but also efficient and scalable, making it a state-of-the-art tool for smart contract analysis and advice.

### UI Development
I adapted and significantly modified the UI from [whuang214](https://github.com/whuang214) This ReactJS and TypeScript-based interface resembles a ChatGPT interaction model, tailored for our specific use case.

### Flask API
This Python-based Flask API serves as a crucial bridge between user queries and the powerful backend. It efficiently handles interactions with the Weaviate vectors and leverages OpenAI's GPT-4-0613 model for generating responses. The choice of GPT-4-0613 is strategic, due to its less restrictive nature, which is particularly beneficial for providing more direct and unfiltered answers on sensitive topics, such as re-entrancy in smart contracts.

For those interested in exploring other OpenAI Language Models, a comprehensive list can be found at [OpenAI's Model Overview](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models).

Additionally, the Flask API integrates LangChain, a framework designed to enhance the capabilities of language models through agents and prompt engineering. LangChain's modular architecture allows for easy integration of different language models, making the system highly adaptable and extendable. With the same interface, various other language models could be seamlessly incorporated, offering flexibility and scope for future enhancements in response capabilities.

The combination of Flask, Weaviate, and LangChain provides a robust, scalable, and versatile backend infrastructure, capable of handling complex queries with precision and delivering contextually relevant responses in the domain of Solidity smart contracts.

### LangChain
[LangChain](https://www.langchain.com/) represents a revolutionary approach in the utilization of language models, playing a vital role in our Solidity Smart-Contract Advisor project. It's a framework specifically designed to augment the capabilities of language models, such as those provided by OpenAI, through the use of agents and augmented retrievals.

#### Power of Agents
In LangChain, agents are modular components that enable a variety of interactions with language models. They can be programmed to perform specific tasks, such as parsing text, generating queries, or handling responses. This modular approach allows for a high degree of customization and flexibility, enabling the creation of complex workflows that can process, analyze, and respond to user queries with unparalleled precision.

#### Augmented Retrievals
One of the key features of LangChain is its ability to perform augmented retrievals. This involves using language models to enhance the retrieval of information from databases or other sources. In the context of this project, LangChain's augmented retrieval capability allows for more sophisticated and contextually relevant searches within the Weaviate Vector Database. It ensures that the retrieved information is not only relevant but also tailored to the specific nuances of Solidity smart contracts.

#### Integration Benefits
The integration of LangChain in this Flask API adds a layer of intelligence and adaptability. It empowers the system to handle complex, multifaceted queries that a standalone language model might struggle with. By leveraging both the raw computational power of language models and the strategic structuring offered by LangChain, the  system can provide in-depth, accurate, and highly relevant responses to a wide range of queries related to Solidity smart contracts.

The use of LangChain essentially transforms the project into a more dynamic, intelligent, and responsive tool, capable of addressing the intricate and evolving needs of Solidity developers and enthusiasts.
